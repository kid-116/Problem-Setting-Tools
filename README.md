# Problem Setting Tools

## Setting Up
- Update `./verifier.cpp` to correctly validate input test case against constraints.
- Update `./generator.py` as required to generate test cases. It is configured to create test case files under the dir - `tests/inputs/` as `in<id>.txt` files.
- Insert your solution to the problem in the file `soln.cpp`.
- Execute `./run.sh` to extract input files generated or inserted manually, validate them and create corresponding output files under `tests/outputs/`.

> **Note** <br />
> The file `tests/inputs/wrong.txt` must be left as it is or a test failing constraints must be entered there.
